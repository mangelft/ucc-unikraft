/**
 * Unikraft Network API
 *
 * The Unikraft netdev API provides a generalized interface between network
 * device drivers and network stack implementations or low-level network
 * applications.
 *
 * Most API interfaces take as parameter a reference to the corresponding
 * Unikraft Network Device (struct uk_netdev) which can be initially obtained
 * by its ID by calling uk_netdev_get(). The network application should store
 * this reference and use it for subsequent API calls.
 *
 * The functions exported by the Unikraft NET API to setup a device
 * must be invoked in the following order:
 *     - uk_netdev
 *     - uk_netdev_configure()
 *     - uk_netdev_txq_configure()
 *     - uk_netdev_rxq_configure()
 *     - uk_netdev_start()
 * The transmit and receive functions should not be invoked when the
 * device is not started.
 *
 * There are 4 states in which a network device can be found:
 *     - UK_NETDEV_UNREGISTERED
 *     - UK_NETDEV_UNCONFIGURED
 *     - UK_NETDEV_CONFIGURED
 *     - UK_NETDEV_RUNNING
